##Simon
Simon is a memory game where the player is tasked to memorize and repeat a sequence of actions performed by the computer. Traditionally, there will be 4 buttons, each identified by a different color, that will be part of the sequence. At the start, one action will be presented to the player. With each succesful action matched by the player, the computer repeats the sequence, adding a new move to the end of the sequence. The game is lost and reverted to the 1st round when the player fails to replicate the correct order.
